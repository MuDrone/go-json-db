# go-json-db
This is a light weight, easily managable and beginner friendly implementation of a Database that anyone can implement directly in their Local Systems. It provides database API's to perform pretty much every operation that one can perform in a traditional database. The aim is to be a worthy contender in the choice of Database for small and medium use cases.

# About
It goes down a No-Sql path ,quite similar to what MongoDB (Atlas) does. This project uses Directories to respresent any new collection and subsequent JSON files in their respective collections, each representing a record. 

The main idea of this project is to bring the complex database processes like caching and mutexes into the most understandable language of Developers i.e. JSON : ).

# Status 
This project is still in infancy. 

Work is going on and we are currently working on providing sufficient API's so that virtually all database operations can be performed in the JSON Database.

Would try implementing advanced database features once we feel confident about the functional working of the database.
